# AWS CDK with Python – S3 Bucket & Lambda Function

This project demonstrates how to use the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) with Python to define and deploy AWS infrastructure using code.

## 🚀 What This Project Does

Using AWS CDK and Python, this project:

- ✅ Creates an **S3 bucket**
- ✅ Deploys a **Lambda function**
- ✅ Connects the Lambda to the S3 bucket (can be extended to trigger on events)
- ✅ Uses **CloudFormation** under the hood to provision resources

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3
- **AWS CDK:** v2.x
- **CloudFormation:** (automatically generated by CDK)
- **Lambda Runtime:** Python 3.x

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### 1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Bootstrap your AWS environment (first time only):
bash
Copy
Edit
cdk bootstrap
3. Deploy the stack:
bash
Copy
Edit
cdk deploy
🧪 Testing
You can run unit tests with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pytest
📌 Notes
Make sure your AWS credentials are configured via aws configure or environment variables.

All infrastructure is defined using CDK and provisioned via CloudFormation.

The lambda/index.py can be modified to add custom logic.
